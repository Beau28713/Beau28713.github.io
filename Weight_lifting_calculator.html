    <h1>Why started the project</h1>
    <p>I started this project to help me keep track of my weight lifting progress. I wanted to be able to input my max
        lifts and have the program calculate my working sets for the day. I also wanted to be able to input my working sets
        and have the program calculate my max lifts.
    </p>
    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>Takes in a weight in lbs and the number of reps. Then returns a calculated max along with the calculated percentages of the largest calculated max.
        For example: say you benched press 255 lb for 10 reps. The app would take those numbers and use the 3 most popular
        max calculation equations and calculate your estimated max bench press.
