        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The Weight Lifting GUI App is designed to assist weightlifters in optimizing their training by providing valuable insights into their strength performance.
             Key Features: Input Weight and Reps: Users can input the weight lifted in pounds and the number of repetitions performed. Calculate Max: The app calculates the estimated maximum weight that the user can lift based on the input data. Percentage Calculation: Additionally, the app calculates the percentages of the estimated maximum weight, providing valuable information for planning workouts and setting goals.
            For instance, if you performed a bench press with 255 lbs for 10 reps, the app would utilize three popular maximum calculation equations to estimate your maximum bench press weight.
        </p>
        <h1>How it works</h1>
