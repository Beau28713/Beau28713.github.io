    <title>Back flushing water lines, flow, and level Monitoring</title>

    <h1>Why started the project</h1>
    <p>I started this project to help my father keep track of his camper’s water supply. My father had to check the
        water level every morning and make sure the flow from the spring hadn’t stopped. If the flow stopped, he would
        need to manually insert a water house into the pipe and Back flush the water lines to rid any sand that may have
        stopped up the line. We installed screens at the spring house to help catch most of the sand
        but some would still make it through. The lines would also become airlocked (I have a plane for this) and the
        backflushing would rid the lines of this blockage.
    </p>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The system is designed to monitor the water level in the spring house and the flow of water from the spring. The
        system will also back flush the water lines if the flow stops. The system will also alert the user if the water
        level is low or if the flow has stopped
    </p>
    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>Utilizing an Arduino as the brain, the system monitors the water level and flow via a tilt switch, float, and a
        water flow sensor. When the water level falls low enough the tilt switch makes contact and the water level input
        pin on the Arduino is pulled low. This pin is read by the Arduino, relay 1 is then activated thus activating a
        servo that switches the position of a 3-way water valve blocking flow into the holding tank and opening access
        to the water lines. Five seconds later the Arduino activates relay 2 turning on a pump. This pump feeds water
        back into the water line backflushing the lines and removing all sand and airlocks. After running for one minute
        relay 2 deactivate turning off the pump. After 5 seconds relay 1 deactivates, this activates the 3-way water
        valve moving it back into its home position allowing water from the spring to once again flow into the holding
        tanks.
        The system also has a manual mode where at any time the sequence of operation can be performed when desired.
