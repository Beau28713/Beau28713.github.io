        <h1>Why started the project</h1>
        <p>I started this project to help my father keep track of his camper’s water supply. My father had to check the
            water level every morning and make sure the flow from the spring hadn’t stopped. If the flow stopped,
            he would need to manually insert a water house into the pipe and Back flush the water lines to rid any sand
            that
            may have stopped up the line. We installed screens at the spring house to help catch most of the sand but
            some
            would still make it through. The lines would also become airlocked (I have a plane for this) and the
            backflushing would rid the lines of this blockage. </p>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The system is designed to monitor the water level in the spring house and the flow of water from the spring.
            The
            system will also back flush the water lines if the flow stops. The system will also alert the user if the
            water
            level is low or if the flow has stopped </p>
        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>Utilizing an Arduino as the brain,
            the system monitors the water level and flow via a tilt switch,
            float,
            and a water flow sensor. When the water level falls low enough the tilt switch makes contact and the water
            level
            input pin on the Arduino is pulled low. This pin is read by the Arduino,
            relay 1 is then activated thus activating a servo that switches the position of a 3-way water valve blocking
            flow into the holding tank and opening access to the water lines. Five seconds later the Arduino activates
            relay
            2 turning on a pump. This pump feeds water back into the water line backflushing the lines and removing all
            sand
            and airlocks. After running for one minute relay 2 deactivate turning off the pump. After 5 seconds relay 1
            deactivates,
            this activates the 3-way water valve moving it back into its home position allowing water from the spring to
            once again flow into the holding tanks. The system also has a manual mode where at any time the sequence of
            operation can be performed when desired. </p>
